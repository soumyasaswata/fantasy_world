# Fantasy Trading Platform

A backend API for a fantasy-world trading platform where users (elves, wizards, dwarves) can trade weapons. The system includes user inventory, trade offers, and trade history.

---
## üìå Features
- **Users**: Elves, Wizards, and Dwarves (no functional difference).
- **Weapons**: Swords, Staffs, Axes, with **variants** (Red, Blue, Green, etc.).
- **Trade Offers**: Users can offer a trade, accept/reject offers.
- **Inventory Management**: Users have an inventory that updates with trade execution.
- **Trade History**: View sent/received offers, filter by status and date range.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Overview

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture**
The backend follows a **modular and extendable** architecture using **Django and Django REST Framework (DRF)**. The system is built to support future enhancements like offer limits, trade analytics, and a ledger system.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Schema**
- **User Model**: Represents users in the system (Elves, Wizards, Dwarves).
- **Weapon Model**: Represents different weapon types (Sword, Staff, Axe).
- **WeaponVariant Model**: Tracks color variations of weapons (Red, Blue, Green).
- **Inventory Model**: Stores user inventory details.
- **TradeOffer Model**: Captures trade offers between users.
- **TradeItem Model**: Stores items involved in a trade.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic**
- **Trade Validation**: Ensures a user has sufficient inventory before making an offer.
- **Transaction Handling**: Uses database transactions for atomic trade execution.
- **Offer Processing**: Allows users to accept or reject trade offers.
- **Historical Data**: Users can view trade history with filters.
